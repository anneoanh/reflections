How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Viewing two versions of the file using the diff function help you see the
difference with the plus and minus sign. + for what's added and - for what was
removed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a
more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Having access to the entire history of a file makes you an efficient programmer
in the long term because you can go back and compare the changes you made with
each version faster.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to
create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved,
like Google
docs does?

Pro: get to choose when to save, less files, save when it makes sense.
Con: forget to save.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow
saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each
file separately?

Saving multiple files allows bundling because git can host a project where
multiple files effect each other where docs are treated as single files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the
history of files?

git log shows all verion changes that were made and save for the file.
git diff lets you compare between 2 files.

How might using version control make you more confident to
make changes that
could break something?

You can track and identify what you changed to go back and undo.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you
want to try using Git for?

I want to use Git to track changes that I made in my code.
